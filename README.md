# goto-first-commit
## Go to the first commit of any github repo handsfree!

Have you ever tried to wonder what the first commits of huge projects look like?
Well it all started with some basic implementation and then slowly and steadily advancing to the complex design structures that make the projects what they are today. So, here I present to you a simple JavaScript code to go to the first commit step by step without tediously clicking the "Older" button again and again.

### Steps
- Open the commit history of repo of your choice by clicking the history icon. Example shown below<br>

- Press Ctrl+Shift+I to open developer tools in your favourite browser
- Navigate to console
- Paste the code and hit Enter!
- Grab some coffee and let magic happen
